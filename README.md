QVNCClient is a Qt Widget that can be used to view and control remote VNC supported hosts (servers)

QVNCClient does not include any OS dependent code and therefore it can be easily used on any platform supported by Qt.

Just drop a QWidget on your user interface and promote it to QVNCClientWidget, as simple as that.
